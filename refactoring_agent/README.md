# Observable Gem Refactoring Agent

A specialized Ruby refactoring system designed to improve production code quality for the Observable gem. This agent uses Claude AI to analyze and refactor Ruby code with a focus on gem-specific patterns, OpenTelemetry instrumentation, and Ruby best practices.

## Overview

The Observable Gem Refactoring Agent is built on the OpenTerra agent system but specifically tailored for Ruby development and the Observable gem's architecture. It provides intelligent code analysis and automated refactoring capabilities to improve:

- **Performance** - Optimize instrumentation overhead and memory usage
- **Code Quality** - Remove code smells and improve maintainability  
- **Ruby Idioms** - Make code more idiomatic and follow gem conventions
- **Architecture** - Improve component organization and reduce coupling
- **Error Handling** - Enhance resilience and graceful degradation
- **Testing** - Improve test coverage and quality
- **Documentation** - Enhance code clarity and API docs

## Features

- Interactive setup and configuration

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ 
- Ruby 3.0+ (for the Observable gem)
- Git

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone or copy the refactoring agent files**:
```bash
cd your-observable-gem-directory
# The refactoring_agent directory should be in your gem's root
```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
```bash
cd refactoring_agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Setup a Claude provider** (choose one):

**Option A: Anthropic Direct**
```bash
# Set environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Or setup interactively
python cli.py setup anthropic
```

**Option B: OpenRouter**
```bash
# Set environment variable  
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Or setup interactively
python cli.py setup openrouter
```

4. **Verify setup**:
```bash
python cli.py list-providers
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

üìã OBSERVABLE GEM REFACTORING SUMMARY
====================================
Total Tasks: 8
Successful: 7 ‚úÖ  
Failed: 1 ‚ùå
Success Rate: 87.5%
Total Actions: 23

Next Steps:
1. Review refactored code and test thoroughly
2. Run full test suite: bundle exec rake test  
3. Check code style: bundle exec standardrb
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Consider performance benchmarks
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No provider configured"**
```bash
python cli.py setup anthropic --api-key your-key
```

**"Task timed out"**
- Large files may need longer timeout
- Consider breaking into smaller refactoring tasks
- Check internet connection for API calls

**"Tests failing after refactoring"**
- Review the specific changes made  
- Check git diff for unintended modifications
- Run individual test files to isolate issues

**"API rate limits"**
- The system includes automatic rate limiting
- Consider using a different provider temporarily
- OpenRouter often has higher rate limits

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export PYTHONPATH=.
python -m rich.logging cli.py refactor performance --workspace .
```

### Reset Configuration
```bash
rm ~/.refactoring-agent-config.json
python cli.py setup anthropic
```

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Refactoring Tasks
You can extend the system with custom refactoring instructions:

```python
from gem_refactor_runner import ObservableGemRefactorRunner, GemRefactorTask

# Create custom task
custom_task = GemRefactorTask(
    task_type="custom_optimization",
    priority=1,
    description="Optimize specific OpenTelemetry patterns",
    files_focus=["lib/observable/instrumenter.rb"],
    success_criteria=["Reduced span creation overhead"]
)

# Run custom task
runner = ObservableGemRefactorRunner()
await runner.run_gem_refactor_plan([custom_task])
```

### Provider Extensions
Add support for additional AI providers by extending `provider_config.py`.
